I will provide you with C++ code, and your task is to add comprehensive, high-quality comments at the top of the code to make it easy to understand when revisited in the future. Your comments should include: (1) a clear statement of the problem being solved, including the problem name and link if available; (2) a breakdown of the Time and Space Complexity; (3) a detailed Step-by-Step Approach describing the logic used; and (4) an easy-to-understand explanation using diagrams where applicable (diagrams are mandatory to visualize logic flow or data structure usage). All explanations should be in simple, beginner-friendly language. Importantly, do not modify the code itselfâ€”only add explanatory content above the code block. If the code corresponds to a competitive programming or interview problem, include the relevant source or reference in the comments as well.
