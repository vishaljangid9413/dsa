Problem: Find the minimum eating speed (represented by `mid`) to eat all the bananas within `k` hours.
- Each pile of bananas is eaten at a rate of `mid` bananas per hour, and any remaining bananas after one hour are counted as a new pile for the next hour.

Time Complexity: O(n log m)
- Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
- The binary search for the optimal speed `mid` runs in O(log m), where `m` is the sum of all bananas divided by the number of hours.
- For each `mid`, the check if it is possible takes O(n), where `n` is the number of piles.
- Hence, the overall complexity is O(n log m).

Space Complexity: O(1)
- Only a constant amount of extra space is used for variables.

Approach:
1. **Sorting the Piles**:
   - Sort the array to make sure we can efficiently work with the largest pile when calculating speeds.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The range for the eating speed (`mid`) is from `1` (smallest possible speed) to the largest pile in the array (`arr[n-1]`).
   - Use binary search to find the minimum eating speed that allows all the bananas to be eaten in `k` hours.

3. **Feasibility Check (`possible` function)**:
   - For each `mid`, calculate how many hours it will take to eat all the bananas. If the total number of hours is less than or equal to `k`, it means that the speed is feasible.
   - The calculation is done by determining how many hours each pile will take at the current speed and summing them up.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are fewer bananas than hours (`k > n`), it's possible to finish within `k` hours with minimal speed.

        // (arr[i] + mid - 1) / mid is used to compute the number of full hours needed to eat each pile
        // its working like ciel,
        // means if devision have remainder then total will +1

    int n = size(arr); // Number of piles
    int hour = 5; // Total hours available to eat the bananas

    // Step 1: Sort the array (You can skip this since itâ€™s unnecessary for the logic, but sorting is fine for other applications)

    // Step 2: Define search space
    // The minimum possible speed is the total number of bananas divided by the total hours (for optimization)

    // If start is 0, set it to 1 to avoid division by zero
    if (!start) start = 1;

    int ans = -1; // Variable to store the result (minimum speed)

    // Step 3: Binary search for the minimum possible speed

        if (possible(arr, n, mid, hour)){
            ans = mid; // Mid is a possible answer, try smaller speeds
            end = mid - 1;
        } else {
            start = mid + 1; // Mid is too small, try larger speeds
        }
    }

    // Output the minimum speed required to eat all bananas in `hour` hours
