ðŸŸ© Problem Statement:
---------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ”¹ Problem Name: Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Search Tree (BST)
ðŸ”¹ Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-in-a-bst/1

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) and two nodes `n1` and `n2`, the task is to find their **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**.
The LCA of two nodes `n1` and `n2` is defined as the deepest node in the BST that has both `n1` and `n2` as descendants 
(where a node can be a descendant of itself).

---------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸŸ¦ Time and Space Complexity:
---------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸ”¸ Time Complexity: O(h)
    - Where `h` is the height of the BST. In the worst case, h = N (for skewed trees); 
      in average cases for balanced BSTs, h = log(N).
ðŸ”¸ Space Complexity: O(h)
    - Due to the recursion call stack. Tail recursion might be optimized, but generally O(h).

---------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸŸ¨ Step-by-Step Approach:
---------------------------------------------------------------
âœ… 1. **Base Case**:
    - If the current root is NULL, return NULL (end of the tree reached).

âœ… 2. **Comparison Logic**:
    - Since it's a BST, all values in the left subtree of a node are smaller than the node,
      and all values in the right subtree are larger.

    ðŸ”¸ If both `n1` and `n2` have values **less than** `root->data`, LCA must be in the **left** subtree.
    ðŸ”¸ If both `n1` and `n2` have values **greater than** `root->data`, LCA must be in the **right** subtree.
    ðŸ”¸ If one of `n1` or `n2` is on the left and the other on the right (or one equals the root),
       then the **current root** is their **Lowest Common Ancestor**.

âœ… 3. **Recursively** apply the same logic until the correct root is found.

Example Tree:
                 20
               /    \
             10      30
            /  \    /  \
           5   15  25  35

Suppose n1 = 5, n2 = 15

Step-by-step:
    - Start at root = 20
    - Both 5 and 15 are < 20 â†’ go left to 10
    - 5 < 10 and 15 > 10 â†’ split path â†’ LCA = 10 âœ…

Another Example:
Suppose n1 = 5, n2 = 30

Step-by-step:
    - Start at root = 20
    - 5 < 20 and 30 > 20 â†’ split path â†’ LCA = 20 âœ…

---------------------------------------------------------------
ðŸŸ¦ Additional Notes:
---------------------------------------------------------------
- This logic leverages the BST property to avoid traversing the entire tree.
- It's important to use node pointers (not just values) to properly apply recursion.
- If this were a normal binary tree (not a BST), a completely different approach (postorder traversal) would be needed.
